# Digital-Systems-FPGA-Projects
A documentation of projects that I have extended from their initial applications in the Digital Systems Laboratory. These specific labs required a significant amount of personal design choices and are a good demonsration of the various concepts that I learnt regarding computer architecture, FPGA development and SystemVerilog.
